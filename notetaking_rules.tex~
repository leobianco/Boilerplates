\section{File system organization}
\begin{itemize}
\item First separate in distinct areas.
\item Then separate into individual projects.
\item Basic directory inside a project (only create as needed, do not have empty folders): \textccc{writing/}, \textccc{code/}, then inside \textccc{writing/} you have \textccc{writing/drafts}, \textccc{writing/paper}. Inside \textccc{drafts} you put preliminary LaTeX files (not necessarily binded to some \textccc{main.tex}), Concepts calculations, photos of boards, anything.
\end{itemize}
