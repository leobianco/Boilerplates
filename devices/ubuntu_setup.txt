My Ubuntu configuration:
The idea is to describe here all steps needed to take from a freshly installed Ubuntu to my current workflow.

* Applications:
    - Install vim-gtx3 (better features such as clipboard).
    - Insync
    - LaTeX distribution
    - Variety (for wallpapers)
    - Firefox
    - draw.io
    - If not already installed: ImageMagick, Shotwell, eVince (document viewer).
    - Zotero
    - Python
    - Zathura PDF

* System settings
    - Appearance:
	- Auto-hide the Dock
    - Multitasking: 
	- Set Dynamic workspaces
    - Keyboard:
	- Compose key: right alt
	- Custom keybindings: alt+c for browser, alt+t for terminal, alt+w for work lwsm layout.
    - Accessibility:
	- Large text
	- Disable animations
	- Repeat keys: on and make it fast
    - Install Gnome Tweaks:
	- Change theme to Yaru-olive-dark
	- Change Caps-Lock to be alternative esc, shift+caps=true caps.
    - Set defaults:
	- Firefox as browser
	- Zathura as pdf reader (I lie the lighthaus theme)

* Shell/bash
    - Copy the .bashrc and .bash_aliases in this folder.
	- If these are lost or old, essentially create aliases to easily edit them on vim, one to edit your .vimrc, others to easily access your work folders and writing documents. Create a function newdraft to copy your ExampleDraft folder into your pwd.
    - Install lwsm to save your workspace layouts.

* vim
    - Install vim-plug
    - Copy the .vimrc stored in this folder to your home directory.
	- If this is not possible (the .vimrc is lost), here is a description of what it contained.
	- vimtex
	- ultisnips
	- auto-pairs
	- goyo
	- I also downloaded two colorschemes: deus and monokai.
	- Commands to auto-save and auto-restore folds/views:
	    autocmd BunWinLeave *.* mkview
	    autocmd BunWinEnter *.* silent loadview
	- Set tabs to be 4 spaces: set tabstop=4
	- Set folding filler characters: set fillchars=fold:\ 
	- Keybinding to enter/exit goyo: nmap <f12> <esc>:Goyo<return> 

* Wallpapers
    - Are saved in this folder.

* Firefox:
    - Install the following extensions:
	- Dark Reader
	- Gnome shell integration
	- Unhook for YouTube.
	- Vimium
	- Url shortener
	- Zotero connector
