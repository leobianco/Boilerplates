\section{File system organization}
\begin{itemize}
\item First separate in distinct areas.
\item Then separate into individual projects.
\item Basic directory inside a work project (only create as needed, do not have empty folders): \textccc{writing/}, \textccc{code/}, then inside \textccc{writing/} you have \textccc{writing/drafts}, \textccc{writing/paper}. Inside \textccc{drafts} you put preliminary LaTeX files (not necessarily binded to some \textccc{main.tex}), Concepts calculations, photos of boards, anything.
\end{itemize}

\section{Writing mathematics}
On a first moment, everything must be inside one of the following environments: (TODO: write this.) Definition, Lemma, Proposition, Theorem, Remark.

TODO: talk about constructing the structural graph.

On a second moment, this is put into a ``natural style''.

\section{Doing calculations}
A calculation is a cascading sequence of equalities or inequalities, where a new level of the cascade is created by the use of one of the following keywords:
\begin{itemize}
\item Let
\item By (reference)
